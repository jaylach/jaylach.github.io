To quote [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism):

> Libertarians seek to maximize autonomy and political freedom, and minimize the state's encroachment on and violations of individual liberties; emphasizing the rule of law, pluralism, cosmopolitanism, cooperation, civil and political rights, bodily autonomy, freedom of association, free trade, freedom of expression, freedom of choice, freedom of movement, individualism, and voluntary association.

Libertarianism is often thought of as a somewhat fringe ideology, yet its roots can be traced as far back as ancient Greece, China, and Israel. In fact, some of the greatest minds of the Enlightenment Era, including John Locke, Adam Smith, Thomas Paine, and Thomas Jefferson, are responsible for shaping many of the key concepts of modern Libertarian philosophy. 

<span class="block">Individualism.</span> Libertarians believe the rights and freedoms of the individual to be of utmost import. We believe these rights to be inherent in all humans, meaning they are not granted by any person, document, or governing body, and as such cannot be taken away. Individuals, as moral agents, have the inalienable right to be secure in their life, liberty, and property. Libertarians reject all forms of collectivism and identity politics.  

<span class="block">Free Markets.</span> Libertarians believe the market must be free from government interference. Individuals must be free to produce and trade in order to not only survive, but also flourish. A free market generates that wealth, and government interference in it actively suppresses the individual's ability to generate wealth for themselves. 

<span class="block">Rule of Law.</span> Libertarians believe the rule of law to be an important foundation of any free society. People should be governed by understood and applicable laws, not the whims of kings, presidents, or any other bureaucrat. The only goal of such laws should be to protect the rights of individuals to pursue happiness in their own ways without favoring any particular outcome or result.

<span class="block">Limited Government.</span> While there is some disagreement amongst Libertarians about how limited a government should be, we all agree it should be limited. Libertarians have great antipathy towards concentrated power, understanding how dangerous it's been throughout human history. We seek, instead, to limit power through separation, checks and balances, and expressly limiting what power any government has over its people. 

<span class="block">Non-Aggression.</span> Libertarians believe aggression to be inherently wrong. In this context, aggression can refer to military force but it also refers to initiating or threatening to initiate any forceful interference of an individual's rights or property.
